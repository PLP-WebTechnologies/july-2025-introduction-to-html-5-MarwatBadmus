        <h3>How to Cook It:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Blend the tomatoes and peppers</li>
            <p>Blend the tomatoes, bell peppers, scotch bonnet, and a small onion into a smooth mixture.</p>
            <li>Parboil the rice</li>
            <p>Rinse the rice with water and boil for about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. This removes extra starch and helps the rice cook better.</p>
            <li>Make your sauce</li>
            <p>In a pot, heat up some oil. Add chopped onions and fry until soft. Then pour in the blended mix and fry until it thickens and the oil rises to the top. You can add tomato paste for richer color and taste.</p>
            <li>Add your spices and seasoning</li>
            <p>Mix in curry powder, thyme, seasoning cubes, bay leaves, and salt. Let it cook for 5–10 minutes so the flavors blend well.</p>
            <li>Add the rice and stock</li>
            <p>Pour in your parboiled rice and stir. Add enough water or stock to just cover the rice. Mix gently.</p>
            <li>Cover and cook slowly</li>
            <p>Reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot tightly and allow the rice to cook by steaming. Avoid stirring too much—it keeps the grains firm.</p>
            <li>Check and serve</li>
            <p>Once the rice is soft and the liquid is gone, turn off the heat. Your Jollof Rice is ready! Serve with fried plantains, grilled chicken, or salad.</p>
